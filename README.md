Hi, my name is Shaun Coulter and I am currently taking part in the University of Toronto's School of Continuing Studies Data Analysis Bootcamp Course. 

Most of the repos here are related to the different modules in the course, but I hope to soon start including my own projects, whether they too are based on data analysis or something else all together.

I am highly interested in data analysis and hope to put my curiosity and will to learn to the test as I work through this course.
