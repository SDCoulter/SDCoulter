Hi, my name is Shaun Coulter, I work full-time and I recently graduated from the University of Toronto's School of Continuing Studies Data Analysis Bootcamp Course. 

Most of the repos here are related to the different modules in the course, but I will be including my own projects, whether they too are based on data analysis or something else all together.

I am highly interested in data analysis and hope to put my curiosity and will-to-learn to the test as I continue learning after the course.
